## Quick Lab 1 - Bootstrap Basics

### Objectives - Quick Lab 1

- Experiment with the .container and .container-fluid classes

### Activity 1

2. View the page in the browser and note the position of the text.
3. Open the developer tools and experiment with what happens to the text when the
    width of the page is changed (using the Device view on Responsive).
4.
   1. In the code for the page, add the following tag to the header to include Bootstrap's
    CSS on the page:

```

    2. Add the follwing tag to the header to include Bootstrap's JavaScript on the page:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

5. Add a class of **container** to the **main** element.

## Quick Lab 2 - Bootstrap Grids

### Objectives

- To use the Bootstrap Grid classes to control the layout on different devices

### Activity

1. Open the file **index.html** from the **QuickLabs/02_BootstrapGrids/starter** folder
    using **live-server** *(Please see step 3 of setting up the environment for help on this)*.
2. In the code add:
   - A *class* of `container` to the `main` element;
   - A `div` with a *class* of `row` inside `main` which contains:
     - *4 divs*, each with a *class* of `col` and some text content to identify it (e.g. Col 1, etc)
3. Save the file and view in the browser.

You should see 4 evenly sized columns that stack once the width of the screen becomes
too small to display the columns evenly with the content.

4. Add another `div` with a *class* of `row` beneath the closing tag of the *previous div with a class of `row`*.
5. In this `div`, add *4 divs* that have:
   - A *class* of `col-md-3`
   - Some text content to identify it (e.g. Col 1, etc)
6. Save the file and view in the browser.

You should notice that whilst the screen width is greater than 768px the columns behave
the same. Once the screen is less than 768px, the second row stacks itself one on top of
the other.

7. Add a further `div` with *class* `row` to the `main` element.
8. Inside this, add *2 divs* that *span the row* in a *5-7* ratio on a small screen device.
9. Save the file and view in the browser.

You should notice that the final row is slightly offset to the others (due to the 'odd' nature
of the split) and remains so until the screen width becomes `576px` or less, at which point it
stacks.

10. Add a final `div` with *class* `row` to the `main` element.
11. Inside this, add *12 divs* that have:
    - Classes `col-12` `col-sm-6` `col-md-3` `col-lg-1`
    - Some text content to identify it (e.g. Col 1, etc)
12. Save the file and view it in the browser.

This creates a multi-step layout for different device sizes commonly used with Bootstrap.

1. Open the file **registration.html** from the
    **QuickLabs/07_BootstrapComponents/starter** folder using **live-server** *(Please see step 3 of setting up the environment for help on this)*.
2. Examine the code supplied - there are a number of comments to indicate where you need to add Bootstrap code - you can get the example code from the Bootstrap documentation.
3. The completed page should have a jumbotron that has a carousel with 3 slides - each slide has 3 identical cards on it. Beneath the jumbotron, there should be a button that opens a modal.  The modal should have a static backdrop and should not close when it is clicked on (i.e. it should only close when the close button is clicked).
